Distribution of the different mtDNA lineages or haplogroups based on _COX1_ marker described in ectoparasitic Varroa mites on their honey bee hosts.

The available maps were initiated by the Ecology and Evolution lab at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology to review and track overtime the presence of different haplogroups worldwide.
