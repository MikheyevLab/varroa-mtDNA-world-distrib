# World Distribution of Varroa mites haplogroups
Distribution of the different mtDNA lineages or haplogroups based on _COX1_ marker described in ectoparasitic Varroa mites on their honey bee hosts.  
  
The available maps were initiated by the Ecology and Evolution lab at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology to review and track overtime the presence of different haplogroups of Varroa distributed worldwide. Click here to directly visualize theses [Varroa maps](https://mikheyevlab.github.io/varroa-mtDNA-world-distrib) either for the invasive _V. destructor_ or _V. jacobsoni_, both on their novel host Western honey bee (_Apis mellifera_) and their original host the Eastern honey bee (_A. cerana_).

## Description and review of the haplogroups and haplotypes

In the folder Data:  
- Read the doc "Haplotypes_revision_description_Varroa.docx"  
- Check the raw data digged from the literature review (68 papers using DNA barcoding to confirm Varroa species presence and 485 sequences available from GenBank)  
  
In the folder Raster_borders:  
- Rasters used to build the maps borders and country polygons on top of OpenStreetMap available with the leaflet R package.
